# Introduction

In this project, we have gotten data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ncaam-march-mania-2021), which contains extensive data of regular season games, and conferences for the NCAA Basketball seasons from 2003-2021. Using this data, I would like to predict the potential scores of the upcoming games in the 2021 March Madness Tournament
```{r gather data, message = F, warning = F}

#Game-by-Game Data
df = read.csv("./data/ncaam-march-mania-2021/MRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv") %>% 
  rowid_to_column("game_id") %>% 
   relocate(WLoc:NumOT, .after = DayNum) %>% 
  mutate(
    Wpoint_diff = WScore - LScore,
    Lpoint_diff = LScore - WScore
  )%>% 
  pivot_longer(
    WTeamID:Lpoint_diff,
    names_to = "stat",
    values_to = "count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(outcome = case_when(
    str_detect(stat, "^W") ~ "win", 
    str_detect(stat, "^L") ~ "loss"
  )) %>% 
  mutate(stat = substr(stat, 2, nchar(stat))) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = stat,
    values_from = count
  ) %>% 
  mutate(TeamID = as.factor(TeamID)) %>% 
  unnest()
  
team_id = read.csv("./data/ncaam-march-mania-2021/MTeams.csv") %>% 
  select(TeamID, TeamName)

df[["TeamID"]] = team_id[match(df[["TeamID"]], team_id[["TeamID"]]) , "TeamName"]

df = df %>% 
  rename(
    TeamName = TeamID
  )


#Season Data
season_df = df %>% 
  group_by(Season, TeamName) %>% 
  summarize_at(vars(Score:point_diff), ~mean(.x))
```
